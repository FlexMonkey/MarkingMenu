`FMMarkingMenu` is an implemtation of the marking menu UI pattern seen in applications such as [Autodesk's Maya](http://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview) ported to iOS. Originally designed by [Gordon Kurtenbach](http://www.autodeskresearch.com/pdf/theses/kurtenbach-phd.pdf), marking menus allow users to navigate through and select from menu heirarchies using a single gesture which appears as a continous mark on the screen.
