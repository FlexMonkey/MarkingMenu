# FMMarkingMenu
A Marking Menu Component for iOS

`FMMarkingMenu` is an implemtation of the marking menu UI pattern seen in applications such as [Autodesk's Maya](http://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview) ported to iOS. Originally designed by [Gordon Kurtenbach](http://www.autodeskresearch.com/pdf/theses/kurtenbach-phd.pdf), marking menus allow users to navigate through and select from menu heirarchies using a single gesture which appears as a continous mark on the screen. 

In my version, the user simply has to tap anywhere on the screen and the marking menu appears in the centre. Dotted menu item arcs indicate crossing that item will open a further menu and solid, thicker menu item arcs indicate an executable menu item.
